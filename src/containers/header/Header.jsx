      <p>It is becoming more apparent that the US is facing a domestic abuse crisis. The CDC finds that around 1 in 3 women report having experienced severe physical violence from an intimate partner in their lifetime.

          That number has only risen in recent years as the Council on Criminal Justice finds that reports of domestic violence have increased 8%.

          Thus, we came up with Silent Safety, a mobile iOS app that speaks to 911 on your behalf when you canâ€™t make noise.

      <div className="gpt3__header-content__input">
        <button type="button">Get Started Below</button>
      </div>
    </div>

      <ImageCarousel />
  </div>
);

export default Header;
